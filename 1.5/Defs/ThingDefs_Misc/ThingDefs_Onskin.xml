	<description>Standard, dark brown fatigues of the Tempestus Scions. These fatigues are able to endure a little more punishment than regular fatigues, but don’t protect the user from hot or cold temperatures as well - but the Storm Troopers are used to operating under those conditions. \n\nThe Tempestus Scions have little in the way of downtime, being given only the minimum of rest time their bodies need. If they are not being deployed, they spend their days sharpening their skills in training, with a high-tech simulator on their voidship giving them the harshest combat conditions they can withstand - and, occasionally, a little more than that, just to push the envelope. \n\nA Scion would tell you that these brutal combat exercises are indeed what they consider to be recreation - after getting used to running them all day every day, they consider the exercises rather fun.</description>

	<description>A uniform of the Armageddon Steel Legion, consisting of a greatcoat (traditionally in the color mustard yellow), boots, and gloves over fatigues.

	<description>A dress uniform of the Mordian Iron Guard, with a golden eagle on the left breast (unfortunately, the Mordianites have been forced to get rid of their golden epaulets by their current circumstances). Unlike most regiments of the Astra Militarum, these uniforms are meant to be worn in battle as well. \n\nThe loss of the epaulets has been a significant blow to the morale of the Iron Guard. To an outsider, it would be a surprise for an aesthetic sacrifice to have such an effect on professional soldiers. However, to the Mordianites, the loss of a critical part of their uniform is a stain upon them - their regimental culture places great emphasis on the dignity of soldier and uniform alike.</description>

However, the survivors emerged from underground bunkers and valiantly fought the Iron Warriors until reinforcements arrived to remove them from the planet. \n\nA few decades later, the Tallarn Desert Raiders regiment was formed, and have specialized in desert warfare ever since.</description>

		<label>Leman Russ Tank</label>
		<description>The standard battle tank of the Imperial Guard, the Leman Russ battle tank is a rugged and dependable armored vehicle. It can kill enemy armored vehicles or blow holes in infantry formations with its mighty 120mm Battle Cannon, and riddle the survivors with holes with its three heavy bolter turrets, with one each on the front and sides. \n\nThe Leman Russ tank was first discovered during the Great Crusade by the Space Wolves, on the planet of Nova Borilia. After exterminating the xenos race that had enslaved the local human population, the triumphant Space Marines retrieved the STC fragment for this tank and named it in honor of their Primarch, Leman Russ. \n\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;Crew:&lt;/color&gt; Driver x1, Gunner x1, Passenger x2\n&lt;color=#bb8f04&gt;Fuel type:&lt;/color&gt; Chemfuel</description>
